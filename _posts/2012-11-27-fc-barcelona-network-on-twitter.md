So, in a previous post we had a look at [how the NBA players follow each other in Twitter](/2012/kevin-durant-the-most-influential-nba-player-on-twitter/) so, we decided to do the same experiment with a smaller dataset, so we choose **FC Barcelona. The network is far cleaner and we can see some interesting groups!**

As you can see it's really easy to see the 3 different groups. One being The current team (red) another being the new players from "La Masia" (pink) and previous players (blue). Special mention that small cluster on the left of the image with the brazilian players.

### Spain national football team network

As a bonus track this is the network of the Spain, we'll let you figure out the two different groups ;)

Oh, a small disclaimer, the data is quite old.  But we don't expect to change much in 3 months. Btw, let us know if you are interested in any team or competition.

We've got them all ;)
