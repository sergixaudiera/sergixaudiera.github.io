Last November 2011, inside the NBA lockout era, we published a [blog post](/2011/are-nba-fans-missing-the-league) wondering if NBA fans where missing the competition. We wrote that post inspired by official websites visits of the principal sports competitions, data was provided by Google Trends.

Taking a look at NBA.com we notice a strong decrease of visitors/hits during the lockout, starting on July and finishing on mid-December when the new season started.

While that took place, two other competitions MLB and NFL reached their record of visits of the past 3 years. MLB pass over its previous record by almost 1M daily unique visitors.

As soon as **NBA** went back to normal, the official site had a huge impact on the net and was the most visited site of December 2011.

NHL site was not affected at all by the NBA lockout, so we can say that NBA fans moved to MLB and NFL during the lockout.

### Sports seasonable (according to official sites visits):

- October - June 		: NBA
- September - February 	: NFL
- April - December 		: MLB
- October - June 		: NHL
