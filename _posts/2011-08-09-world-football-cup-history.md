For thoses of you loving soccer (we know plenty of you do), we have found an awesome dataset. This is a great World Football Cup History Dataset update untill 2010.

In this dataset you will find all Fifa World Cup stats, for every single match, player or year competition. We really belieave this is one of the best soccer datasets avaiable on the net.

I love the 94's final, played on July 17 at 12:30pm in Los Angeles, RÃ³mario is one of my all time favorite players!
