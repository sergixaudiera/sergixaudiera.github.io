Another month, here it is the monthly **Numballs Social Sports Report**.

During 2013's August our best audience gainers ranking has been more equally distributed than July. In August's top ten we can find four athletes, four teams and two competitions.

If we talk about sports, soccer is the clear winner, all the profiles who have made the top ten are soccer related. The first non soccer related account is Lebron James (#12).
