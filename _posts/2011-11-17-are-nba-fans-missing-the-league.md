To answer this question we have checked Google Trends for Websites and query a request for the official sites of the 4 biggest competitions in the US.

We found that for the first time since January 2009 [NBA.com](http://nba.com) is the site with less visits among the 4 biggest leagues. We have also note that [MLB.com](http://mlb.com)  and [NFL.com](http://nfl.com) are having their best results in the period.
