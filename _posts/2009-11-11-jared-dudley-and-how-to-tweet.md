Jared Dudley <a href="https://twitter.com/JaredDudley619">@JaredDudley619</a> - Phoenix Suns is one of the NBA players who are on twitter that have understood better what it means. From the first begginings he always has been an active in all conversations around his team and his own person, listening, chatting and replying.

He's main goal is to put the Suns and all NBA fans inside the team's rutine, showing the hotels, asking questions to the players while they're moving on the bus, workouts pics, ... and it's been succesful with that. Just see the video below and all his streaming by <a href="http://twitpic.com/photos/jareddudley619">pictures </a>and <a href="http://www.twitvid.com/videos/jareddudley619">video. </a>
