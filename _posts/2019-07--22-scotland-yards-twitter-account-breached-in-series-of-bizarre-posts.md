[★ Kevin Rawlinson, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jul/20/scotland-yards-twitter-account-breached-in-series-of-bizarre-posts):

> In the early hours of Saturday, after apparently regaining control of its output, Scotland Yard said it believed the “security issue” related solely to the external service the Met’s press bureau uses to issue news releases. It said the MyNewsDesk service automatically spreads content to the Met’s website and Twitter account once it is published, as well as sending corresponding emails to subscribers.

> “While we are still working to establish exactly what happened, we have begun making changes to our access arrangements to MyNewsDesk. We apologise to our subscribers and followers for the messages they have received.

How important is to secure all public official accounts. My kudos to the human how fixed it on Saturday morning.
