After several hours and many beers we can say that version 0.2 of numballs is finally online! Do you want to know what have we been doing? Just read this post and please contact us for any feedback.

- We’ve add some nice charts using [Highcharts](http://www.highcharts.com/) instead of Ggoogle Charts images. Now you can interact with the charts, zoom it, and save it as image or pdf.  
- Now teams and competitions show their own chart.  
- New competition: UEFA Euro 2012.  
- Some front-end issues, while we’re working in a site full redesign.  
- Great improvements on the backend (sorry you will not notice them :P)  

We also have been designing and trying a new system to read on-the-fly social media, as a result we now have 1.5M tweets about the Champions League final ready to be analyzed, so stay tuned!
