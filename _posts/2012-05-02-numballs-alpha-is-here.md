Finally and several months later numballs is here! In this alpha version we have focused our efforts to develop a solid back end with a huge social sports database.

Current site does:

- Lists every official social media account for every single player, team or competition.
- Rank top athletes on social platforms, these rankings can be filtered by each of the 20 competitions.
- Track more than 20 competitions, and their data. We are collecting daily some of the most relevant social media metrics for every single player, team and global competition in numballs.
- Add every single official athlete and team you find on twitter or facebook to our database.
- Hype charts: which are the athletes who got more social media buzz during last week ?

All your suggestions, bug reports and feedback are welcome! and remember you can reach us at **07734@numballs.com**.
