Diving on Slideshare I found two great presentations. As you might know I love sports and I admire how the professional US teams are doing in social media. They're being succesfull going inside their fans communities, and the fans are taking advantage of that, with a more social and human teams, where players and coaches are very close to they.

So after this brief introdction I'm leaving you with the Minnesota Timberwolves (NBA) & Lynx (WNBA) and Atlanta Dream (WNBA) case studies.
