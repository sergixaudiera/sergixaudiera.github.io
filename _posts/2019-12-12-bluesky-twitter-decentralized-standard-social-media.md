I like Twitter last moves. I don't like they want to build a decentralized standard for social media when there is already [ActivityPub](https://github.com/w3c/activitypub) and tools like [Mastodon](https://github.com/tootsuite/mastodon) working on it. 

> Twitter is funding a small independent team of up to five open source architects, engineers, and designers to develop an open and decentralized standard for social media. The goal is for Twitter to ultimately be a client of this standard.
>
> Twitter was so open early on that many saw its potential to be a decentralized internet standard, like SMTP (email protocol). For a variety of reasons, all reasonable at the time, we took a different path and increasingly centralized Twitter. But a lot’s changed over the years…
>
> First, we’re facing entirely new challenges centralized solutions are struggling to meet. For instance, centralized enforcement of global policy to address abuse and misleading information is unlikely to scale over the long-term without placing far too much burden on people.

Other great idea would be to make Twitter API as a new standard where to start the work. Well, despite the criticisms It's a thing I would like.

> What’s the downside to letting the Twitter API as it stands be v1.0? Let third parties implement it, clients could connect to any compatible service, communication between services would evolve as needs evolve, you end up with something designed naturally (see HTML5 vs XHTML).
