Since we launched [Numballs](http://numballs.com), we have been exploring new ways to cross social media data with most traditional sports marketing metrics. We trust social data, we believe digital interactions are good business indicators, at least as good as other traditional metrics.

This time we explored NBA teams. We have mixed economic data by [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/nba-valuations/list/) and social media data by Numballs.

In these two plots we can see a correlation between social audience and economic power. Not a surprise. It's normal that teams with the high revenues are those with a bigger volume of social audience. People love successful teams, and successful teams earn more money.

There is one exception for both of the plots though. As you probably guessed this team is the New York Knicks. The most valued team is only the 5th on social audience with 4.62M, far from the 1st, Los Angeles Lakers.
