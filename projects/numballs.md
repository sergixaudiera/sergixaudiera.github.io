<aside>numballs app (2012 - 2018)</aside>
An amazing webapp (mongodb, angularjs), that collected data (java, api) from social media platforms (twitter, facebook, instagram) and gather into a site that allowed users to explore and slice data to get meaningful marketing insights. 

Made with ❤ Marc de Palol and Roger Bramon ❤.
